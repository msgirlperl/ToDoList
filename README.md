# ToDoList
## A simple app I built for a coding challenge to play around with React

The following were the instructions given to me:

Create a grouped task list with task dependencies

1. Build a task list UI in React using included design and SVG assets
2. The top level should show a list of task groups w/ # of tasks inside
3. Clicking a group should display the list of all tasks for that group
4. Tasks remain locked until all dependent tasks are complete
5. Clicking a task should mark it as complete or incomplete, unless the task is locked
6. Dependencies that don't point to a loaded task should be ignored**

** For clarification, I asked:
>Could you please clarify #6 in the requirements? "Dependencies that don't point to a loaded task should be ignored" Do you mean that >for a given task, if a dependencyId is not in the same group, the dependent task's completion status does not impact >whether the given >task is locked?

The response was:
>Basically it means that if a given task has a dependency on a task that wasn't included in the payload, it should be filtered out. So >for example, if you look at task 8, it depends on task 11. Task 11 isn't included in the payload though, so that means you can ignore >that particular dependency (i.e. it has no effect on the lock status of the task).

Example Payload:
```
const tasks = [
  {
    id: 1,
    group: "Purchases",
    task: "Go to the bank",
    dependencyIds: [],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    group: "Purchases",
    task: "Buy hammer",
    dependencyIds: [1],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    group: "Purchases",
    task: "Buy wood",
    dependencyIds: [1],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    group: "Purchases",
    task: "Buy nails",
    dependencyIds: [1],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    group: "Purchases",
    task: "Buy paint",
    dependencyIds: [1],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    group: "Build Airplane",
    task: "Hammer nails into wood",
    dependencyIds: [2, 3, 4],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    group: "Build Airplane",
    task: "Paint wings",
    dependencyIds: [6],
    completedAt: null,
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    group: "Build Airplane",
    task: "Have a snack",
    dependencyIds: [11],
    completedAt: null,
  }
];
